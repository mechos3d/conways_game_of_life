Page showing 20x20 board.
Initial position is preset ( no user input for this yet )
Send this to server - starts game. (endpoint /start)
Server responds five times with motions.
Now user can add a point. (endpoint /add_cell)
.. and so on..

In the future - other player can join the game.
And when two players are in the game - server sends a signal to input a cell to only one of them - the other one just waits.

 ---
Simpler option with no websockets - server returns one step. User can add another cell or proceed without adding.
